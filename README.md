# PyroSys

PyroSys: A dynamic framework for PYthon based computational pROtein SYStems biology.

PyroSys is an open-source Python framework that ignites new possibilities in computational structural biology. Just as pyrophosphate bonds drive the energetics of biological systems, PyroSys powers the analysis of protein structures and their dynamic interactions through an integrated systems biology approach.

## 🌟 Why PyroSys?

PyroSys bridges the gap between traditional deep learning domains (CV/NLP) and protein structure prediction, making it simpler to transfer your expertise to this exciting field.

### Key Features

- 🔥 Ready-to-use Implementations:
PyroSys provides a set of state-of-the-art protein structure prediction models that can be easily integrated into your own projects.
- 🚀 Accelerated Development:
Focus on your innovative ideas rather than struggling with protein-specific implementation details. PyroSys provides a high-level API that abstracts away the complexities of protein structure encoding and decoding.
- ⚙️ Flexible Customization:
PyroSys provides a modular design that allows you to easily customize the models and training procedures to fit your specific needs.

### 🎯 Our Vision

- 🔬 Researchers: We aim to provide biologists the most easy to use and effective tools for protein structure prediction and generation with **state-of-the-art models** and **commercially-free licenses**.
- 🛠️ Developers: You can easily build your own protein structure prediction models with PyroSys transitioning from CV/NLP to protein structure prediction.
- 🎓 Students: You can learn about computational biology and deep learn.

## Installation Guide

PyroSys is avaliable on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pyrosys/) and [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pyrosys).
We recommend using conda to install PyroSys.

TODO! Update conda installation, for Helixon users, we need to use source code installation right now.

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge -c pytorch -c nvidia pytorch pytorch-cuda pyrosys
```
Conda based installation is recommended.
If you want to install the latest version or you want to contribute to PyroSys, please refer to the [Development Guide](./docs/development.md).
